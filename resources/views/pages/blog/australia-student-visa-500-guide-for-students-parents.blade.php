<p>
Australia remains one of the most sought-after study destinations in the world, known for its high-quality education system, multicultural environment, and student-friendly policies. If you are planning to pursue higher education in Australia—or supporting your child’s academic goals—understanding the <strong>Student Visa Subclass 500</strong> is essential.
</p>

<p>
This comprehensive 2025 guide explains the student visa application process, eligibility requirements, recent policy changes, and how professional guidance from <strong>Quality Migration</strong> can help make your journey smoother.
</p>

<h4>What Is the Australia Student Visa Subclass 500?</h4>
<p>
The Student Visa Subclass 500 allows international students to live and study in Australia while enrolled in a full-time course with a CRICOS-registered education provider. Depending on the course length, students may stay in Australia for up to five years.
</p>

<p>
This visa also permits part-time work of up to <strong>48 hours per fortnight</strong> during study periods and unlimited hours during scheduled course breaks.
</p>

<p>
The Subclass 500 visa applies to a wide range of programs, including:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Higher education (universities)</li>
    <li>Vocational Education and Training (VET)</li>
    <li>English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS)</li>
    <li>School-level education</li>
</ul>

<p>
Eligible dependants, including partners and children, may accompany the primary student under specific conditions.
</p>

<h4>Latest Student Visa Updates in 2025</h4>
<p>
In 2025, the Australian Department of Home Affairs introduced significant reforms to strengthen the integrity of the student visa system and ensure that only genuine students apply.
</p>

<h4>Increased Visa Application Fees</h4>
<p>
From <strong>1 July 2025</strong>, the base application fee for the Student Visa Subclass 500 increased from AUD 1,600 to <strong>AUD 2,000</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Adult dependants: AUD 1,225</li>
    <li>Child dependants: AUD 400</li>
</ul>

<p>
Applicants should carefully consider these costs when planning their education budget.
</p>

<h4>Offshore-Only Student Visa Applications</h4>
<p>
One of the most significant policy changes in 2025 is the requirement that all new student visa applications must be lodged offshore. Onshore applications and extensions are no longer permitted.
</p>

<p>
Students currently in Australia on other visa types must return to their home country before applying for a student visa.
</p>

<h4>Mandatory Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE)</h4>
<p>
A valid <strong>Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE)</strong> is now compulsory at the time of visa lodgement. Offer letters or conditional admission letters are no longer accepted.
</p>

<p>
The CoE confirms enrolment in a full-time CRICOS-approved course and is issued after accepting an offer and paying the required tuition deposit.
</p>

<h4>Annual Student Intake Caps</h4>
<p>
To manage migration levels, the Australian Government introduced an annual cap of approximately <strong>270,000 student enrolments</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>145,000 places for universities</li>
    <li>95,000 places for vocational education and training (VET)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Due to these limits, students are strongly encouraged to apply early to secure their place.
</p>

<h4>Stricter Financial and English Language Requirements</h4>
<p>
Applicants must now demonstrate increased financial capacity. The required annual living cost threshold has risen to approximately <strong>AUD 29,710</strong>, in addition to tuition fees and travel expenses.
</p>

<p>
English language requirements have also been tightened. Most applicants must achieve:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>IELTS 6.0 overall</li>
    <li>No band lower than 5.5</li>
</ul>

<p>
Equivalent scores from PTE Academic, TOEFL iBT, or Cambridge English may be accepted, depending on the education provider.
</p>

<h4>Eligibility Criteria for Student Visa Subclass 500</h4>
<p>
To qualify for a student visa in Australia, applicants must meet the following requirements:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Enrollment in a CRICOS-registered full-time course with a valid CoE</li>
    <li>Genuine intention to study temporarily in Australia</li>
    <li>Sufficient financial evidence</li>
    <li>English language proficiency</li>
    <li>Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) for the entire stay</li>
    <li>Health examinations and character clearances</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step-by-Step Student Visa Application Process</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Choose a CRICOS-approved course and institution</li>
    <li>Apply and receive your Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE)</li>
    <li>Prepare required documents, including financial and health evidence</li>
    <li>Lodge your visa application online</li>

</ol>
